  <p>If you have ever played video games you know the feeling of winning to be quite amazing. You also know the feeling of loss to feel like a kick to the axels, speaking in Rocket League terms. If you read my last article (<a href="https://unit-1-project-cis-099.cadelawless795.repl.co/">The Best Cars in Rocket League</a>), you know that I am pretty invested into this game. With that being said, I can let you in on a little secret that this game is very addictive.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reasons Why the Game is so Addictive
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If you win a match, you get a sense of victory and pride</li>
        <li>You then crave that feeling again and again; it makes you play again</li>
        <li>If you lose a match, you get a little triggered; you want to keep playing to make up for your losses</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

      Ways to Avoid Addiction
      <ol type="a">
        <li>There are none</li>
        <li>Please reach out if you find a way</li>
        <li>It is taking over my life</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This game is very well-created and I give all the credit to <a href="https://www.psyonix.com/">Psyonix</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/">Epic Games</a>. They both played a great part in making this game so dang addictive. I hope they will continue to do great work within this community and that Rocket League will never die&period;</p>
