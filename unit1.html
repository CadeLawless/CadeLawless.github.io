    <h1>Best Cars in Rocket League</h1>
    <p>Rocket League is a free-to-play video game that involves various different rocket-powered vehicles playing soccer or "soccar." There is a small amount of cars that beat out all others in the game in terms of a few different factors.</p>
    <p>These factors include things like turn radiuses, shot power, dribbling, aerialing, hitboxes, and speed. All vehicles in Rocket League have strengths and weaknesses in these categories. The following three cars, in my opinion, are the best in the game, as their strengths heavily outweight their weaknesses.</p>
